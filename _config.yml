  Hi, my name is Dat and I am a fourth-year student majoring in Control and Automation Engineering. With a strong passion for automation and a constant eagerness to learn, I am eager to work alongside experienced professionals in the field. During my years at university, I have gained foundational knowledge in various areas of automation, including <mark>PLCs</mark>, <mark>microcontrollers (MCUs)</mark>, <mark>artificial intelligence (AI)</mark>, and <mark>semiconductors</mark>. I am proficient in two foreign languages: <mark>Japanese</mark> and <mark>English</mark>, with a particular strength in reading and understanding technical documents in English. I have also participated in scientific research and contributed to academic publications. I am currently seeking a position that aligns with my background and passion.
